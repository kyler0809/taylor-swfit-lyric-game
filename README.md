The lyric-game folder contains the frontend, and the server folder contains the backend.

Additional Information on reading the program:
This program contains two folders: lyric-game and server. 
lyric-game is the client folder (frontend) and server is the backend folder which uses Node.js. 
The lyric-game folder contains 4 components: Create, MainPage, SecondaryPage, and SummaryPage. 
All of these files have descriptions within them. 
Also, all the CSS is done in App.css, which contains a lot of code because I was messing around with different CSS features to test out different designs.
